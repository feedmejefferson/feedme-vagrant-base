# Feedme vagrant basebox

This project is intended to download locally all of the binaries necessary to support offline development and usage of a virtual environment for the feedme site.

For now this means two main components:

* httpd (apache webserver)
* java jre (for running but not developing the already build hunger app)

To install the base box from scratch, just run the install script:

    ./install.sh
